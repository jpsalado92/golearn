## Reasons to use Go

### Simple and readable language that makes Software Engineering easier

*"Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language."* - Go FAQ

Goals of Go:
- **Simplicity**, **safety** and **readability**
- One right way to do things
- Ease of expressing algorithms
- Orthogonality (Each operation should do a single thing well, and there should be no overlap in functionality between operations.)

### Leverage multiple logical processors

- Go is designed to leverage multiple logical processors. Which is not used that often by older languages.
- Used in known producs as Docker, Kubernetes, Grafana, Prometheus, etc.

### It makes software perform better in the cloud.
